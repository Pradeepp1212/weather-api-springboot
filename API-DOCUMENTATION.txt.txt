## What this API does:
Simple weather data fetching API built with Spring Boot to demonstrate core business logic and API integration concepts.

**Note:** This is a basic implementation focused on business logic flow - no security layers or comprehensive error handling (try-catch) implemented. The goal is to showcase clean API integration and data processing workflow.

## How to use:
